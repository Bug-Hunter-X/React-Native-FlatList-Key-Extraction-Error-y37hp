To solve this, ensure your keyExtractor function provides a unique key for every item in your data array.  The best practice is to use a unique identifier from your data, like a database ID. If you don't have such an ID, you might need to generate one.  Here's how to implement a robust keyExtractor:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={yourData}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.id.toString() || index.toString()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <YourItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
/>
```

This improved keyExtractor function first attempts to use the 'id' property of each item. If 'id' is not available or null, it falls back to the index as a key.  However, index as a key is a less preferred solution, as it will not correctly handle data mutations.

Always prioritize using a unique, stable identifier from your data source. If this is not possible you will have to rethink your data structure.
