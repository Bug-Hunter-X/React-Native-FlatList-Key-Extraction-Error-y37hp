This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render items that contain complex or deeply nested components.  The root cause is that the FlatList's keyExtractor prop isn't properly identifying unique keys for each item, leading to unexpected behavior like incorrect rendering, component flickering, or crashes.  This often happens when the data source is an array of objects, and the keyExtractor function relies on a property that might not be unique across all items or changes frequently. For example, if you rely on an auto-incrementing ID that is not guaranteed unique, problems might arise.
