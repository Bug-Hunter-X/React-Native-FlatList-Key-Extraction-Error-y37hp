This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: incorrect key extraction. The `bug.js` file shows an example of how using an inappropriate key can cause rendering issues. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the solution by implementing a proper keyExtractor function that uses a unique identifier for each item. This is crucial for optimal performance and correct rendering of the FlatList.
